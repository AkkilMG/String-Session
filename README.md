## My Experience

  Its Fast Then I Thought. Its Good For Users Who Use Userbot Or Other Bot Which are Deployed(Hosted) Through VPS By One Click
This Will Help You In Getting The String Session in Two Unique Python Library Which Are Pyrogram And Telethon Library. The 
Session Will Be Sent To Your Accounts Saved Message. 

  If Any Issues Open An [Issues](https://github.com/HeimanPictures/String-Session/issues/new/choose) Or Contact Me Through My [Support](https://github.com/HeimanPictures/String-Session/blob/Main/README.md#support) Group..

### Remember

- Don't Ever Share Session Code With Others And Change Session Codes, if you have Shared.
- Don't Depend On Others For This Little Job.
- Try Using Phone Number When Running The Script As It Will Not Give Error and Won't Be Lost.
- The Verification Code Will Be Sent To Telegram Account. So, There Is No Need Of Your Phone 
Number On Your Device (For Virtual Number Users).
- Don't Use Single String To All Bots Which Needs String Session As Vars. As You Can Generate
New Session.

### To-Do

- Add Repl.it Support ( Coming Soon )
